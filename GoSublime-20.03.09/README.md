## Intro

GoSublime is an IDE-like plugin for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) mainly, but not limited to, providing integration for most of your Go/Golang development tools.

See https://margo.sh/b/hello-margo/ for a brief introduction to margo, the engine behind GoSublime.

## Installation & Support

See https://margo.sh/b/migrate/ for instructions on how to install GoSublime.

## Features

- code completion from Gocode (fork);
- context aware snippets via the code-completion popup;
- sublime build system(ctrl+b) integrating with GoSublime 9o command prompt with live command output;
- lint/syntax check as you type or on save;
- quickly jump to any linter error reported in any open file or package;
- quickly fmt your source or automatically on save to conform with your coding standards;
- easily create a new go file and run it without needing to save it first (9o `replay`);
- share your snippets (anything in the loaded file) on play.golang.org;

- automatically add/remove package imports;
- quickly jump your import section(automatically goes to the last import) where you can easily edit the pkg alias and return to where you were before;
